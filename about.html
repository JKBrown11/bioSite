        <p>Wayne Brown is a married man with one child. He also happens to be my husband.
        He enjoys playing video games, tabletop games, reading, and watching tv. He is excellent
        at dad jokes and troubleshooting. He is from the same hometown as me.
        </p>
        <p>He was in the US Navy for 6 years before returning 'home' to the Southeastern US.
        His family started shortly after entering the Navy and grew to include one more during that
        time. Since then, he has obtained a bachelor's degree in information technology, and will
        have a master's in cyber security before 2024 year-end. All his post military education was
        paid for by a benefit of military service known as the Montgomery GI Bill.
        </p>
        <p>Currently for work, Wayne installs and maintains security systems for local
        business chains in the state. This includes security cameras, safe repair, and lock box
        unlocking. When he is not busy with work and school, he enjoys spending time with his
        family or enjoying a nice hobby.</p>
        <figure class = "card2" ><img src = "images/good_pupper.jpg" alt ="Yellow lab waiting attentively for toy to be thrown."></figure>
        <p>Wayne's current hobbies include online gaming, reading, and watching tv. If he had
        an unlimited budget for hobbies, he would likely have a metal forge and a wood shop. One
        of his favorite books of all time is The Hitch-hiker's Guide to The Galaxy by Douglas Adams.
        One of his favorite tv shows is Doctor Who from BBC America.</p>
        <p>Overall, Wayne is an excellent husband, father, and a well-rounded human. He
        enjoys making people laugh and playing with puppies.</p>
