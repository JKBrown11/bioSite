            <h2>Military Service</h2>
            <p>Wayne considers his military service a cornerstone of his current life. His absence in his hometown for the initial 
                training left a gap in many hearts. Countless letters to and from home helped remind him that his conditions were 
                temporary. After initial training, he proposed to a former roommate, and his previous life joined his new. His 
                time in the Navy taught him many things about electronics, server maintenance, and radar systems. Much of the 
                training he received carries over to general security principles he currently employs elsewhere. </p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>As mentioned in the short biography, Wayne is a current student under the GI Bill pursuing a master's degree 
                in cyber security. His ultimate goal is to be a penetration tester, but there are several more certificates 
                and years of experience required to meet that goal. As he progresses into a highly skilled field, he is hopeful 
                that he will earn opportunities to better his life. </p>

            <h2>Professional Gamer</h2>
            <p>If all of life's troubles didn't require steady income to provide food and shelter, Wayne might 
                choose a more laid back career. He has often stated that if he could make legitimate money playing
                 video games, he would. As technology continues grow, and platforms like Twitch and YouTube continue
                  to be popular, the idea isn't terribly far-fetched. However, dad-jokes (good or bad) may limit his audience. </p>
